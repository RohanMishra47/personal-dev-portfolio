## 🌐 Personal Developer Portfolio

A full-stack developer portfolio built with **React** and **Express.js** — designed to showcase projects dynamically, integrate with GitHub in real time, and stay lightweight yet scalable.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Vanilla CSS (transitioning to Tailwind CSS)
- **Backend**: Express.js, REST API, JSON-based data handling
- **Integration**: GitHub API for fetching real repositories

🔗 **Live Link:** [View Project Here](https://personal-dev-portfolio-front-git-6b1edc-rohanmishra47s-projects.vercel.app/)

> **Note:** This project runs on a free/hobby backend. Initial requests may experience a short delay (cold start). Please wait a few seconds or refresh if needed.

## ✨ Features

🔹 **Dynamic Project Loading**: All projects are fetched via REST API instead of hardcoded lists
🔹 **GitHub Integration**: Automatically displays live repositories from my GitHub profile
🔹 **Responsive UI**: Fully mobile-friendly with a minimalist layout
🔹 **Backend Ready for Deployment**: Express server configured for hosting and API routing

## 🧩 Future Improvements

- Migrate entire frontend styling to Tailwind CSS
- Buy a domain for better accessibility of my site.
